# UE4RuntimeTransformer
A Runtime Gizmo Transformer tool helps you translate/rotate/scale objects in runtime! Easily provide editing tools to your final product!

Showcase Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zys_jv5zyk

This is a UE4 Plugin made using C++ and Blueprints in Unreal Engine 4.25 (Check previous commits for 4.22, 4.24 version Content assets)

Is Network Replicated? YES!

Plugin targeted for both :
- Users that want to customize absolutely everything, from how the Gizmo looks like, to how it behaves and how it interacts with different objects
- Users that just want to quickly implement a Gizmo System in their game without having to customize much!

# Version 1.0 Features

- Plugin designed to work with both Actors and Components and their respective Local Spaces(e.g. moving Components in their Relative space instead of moving them in Actor Local Space)

- Replication Available! Clients can also transform objects, and everybody will see changes reflected on objects that are set to replicate. Or only have a Listen Server do the transformations! (See Example Project for an overview)

- Translation, Rotation, Scaling Available for Single & Multiple Actors/Components

- World Space & Local Space are both available for Translation and Rotation. Scaling is restricted to only work in Local Space.

- Cloning selections (for example, by holding a button while dragging) is supported. Components maintain hierarchy. Component-only cloning + Actor cloning are both supported in single player. Actor cloning is supported in multiplayer.

- Destruction of Selected Actors/Components supported.

- Snapping is supported for all transformations. Translation and Rotations are snapped based on their delta value, while Scaling is snapped based on the absolute value.

- Most functionality can be overriden (in both Blueprints & C++) for custom additional logic.

- UFocusable Interface for specific objects that require specific logic when Focused(Selected), Unfocused (Unselected), and when there is a Delta Transform pending.

# Example Assets Included
- Post Process Material for Object Selection
- Example Gizmo Meshes to make your own personalized Gizmo
- Example Gizmo Materials
- Example Gizmo Child Blueprints for each Transformation

# Current Known Issues
- When Rotating and Scaling, the Gizmos shake just a little bit. This can go unnoticed but
still an issue that needs fixing.
- For now, the Binaries are only compiled for Windows only. Those that wish to distribute to Linux or Mac should have to compile the plugin in those machines as well.
- Component cloning is not Network Replicated. This is due to the fact that the Assets bound to these Objects are not replicated so, although the Component might be replicated (e.g. a TextRender Component), the content will be the default content in the Client, and not the content set in the Server (e.g. for TextRenderComponent, text content, font settings, etc will not be replicated). See "PluginLimitations.txt" for more info
